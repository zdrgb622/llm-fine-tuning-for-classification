**bert.ipynb**: A notebook that fully fine-tunes a BERT model.

**fine-tune-llama.ipynb**: A notebook that uses LoRA to perform prompt fine-tuning on the llama-3b-instruct model.

**test-llama.ipynb**: A notebook that tests the fine-tuned LLaMA model on a small dataset and on an LLM-generated domain dataset.

**test-llama-to-60000-data.ipynb:** A notebook that evaluates the fine-tuned LLaMA model using a large traditional DGA dataset as well as an LLM-generated domain dataset.

**test-the-bert.ipynb:** A notebook that tests the fully fine-tuned BERT model on both a traditional DGA dataset and an LLM-generated domain dataset.
